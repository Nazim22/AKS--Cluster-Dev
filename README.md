## Executive Summary

This document outlines a Proof of Concept (POC) to validate a secure, automated, and production-ready architectural pattern for deploying applications on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The primary objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of managing the entire infrastructure lifecycle via a GitOps workflow, leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. The successful completion of this POC will establish a standardized blueprint for migrating future workloads to a modern, scalable, and secure cloud-native platform, ensuring seamless and secure integration with existing corporate network and identity services.

## üéØ Business Objective & Problem Statement

### Objective
To increase development velocity, enhance security posture, and improve operational efficiency by creating a standardized, automated platform for cloud-native applications.

### Problem Statement
The current process for deploying cloud infrastructure can be manual and inconsistent, leading to slower delivery cycles, potential security vulnerabilities, and configuration drift. A lack of a standardized, automated platform creates operational overhead and hinders our ability to scale effectively. This POC addresses the need for a secure, repeatable, and auditable process for infrastructure provisioning and application deployment.
